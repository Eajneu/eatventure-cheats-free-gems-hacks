# Eatventure game Cheats unlimited gems and coins Hacks guide

Eatventure game Cheats unlimited gems and coins Hacks guide - Although the positions of various foods on the table are very limited at the beginning, the progress is very fast in the early stage of the game. Once you unlock about 14 or 15 different foods, several varieties on the table may become a bit confusing. You may even need a period of time to find similar foods, or even miss some. In order to have a more systematic way of combining your food, try putting the highest food in the food trough at the bottom right corner of the table. There may not be enough time to meet your Eatventure level of each food, but since it is extremely impossible to put one of each food on the table at the same time, you can be sure that following this method will always leave you enough work space.
